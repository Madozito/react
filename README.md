## ðŸ“‹ Requirements
Verify that you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```node
node --version
```

Also, you can verify that you have npm (Node Package Manager) installed with:
```node
npm --version
```

## Installation
To install React and create your first project, use the following commands in your terminal:
```node
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

```

## Recommended Extensions for your Browser

We recommend installing the following extensions for your browser:

* React Developer Tools: allows you to view React components and profiles.

## File Structure
When working with React, you'll encounter the following file structure:

* `.gitignore`: specifies which files and folders to ignore when committing to GitHub.
* `node_modules`: where all the project's dependencies are stored.
* `package.json`: shows the project's installed dependencies.
* `public`: where the HTML file of the web app is loaded.
* `src`: where the app's components and CSS files are located.
* `App.js`: the main component of the app.
* `index.css`: the main style sheet.
* `index.js`: where the React framework is loaded and the starting point of the app is specified (<App/>).

## ES7 Snippet for React
When writing React code, we recommend using the `ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native` snippets extension, which provides you with various useful snippets such as:

* `rfce`: creates a functional component with an export statement.
* `rfc`: creates a functional component without an export statement.
* `rcc`: creates a class component with a constructor, render, and export statement.


That's it! This should give you a good starting point for working with React.
We will continue updating it, so stay in touch!.
